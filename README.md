# CRUD-REST-API

CRUD-REST-API will be able to handle the HTTP request methods that correspond to the PostgreSQL database from which the API gets its data. You'll also learn how to install PostgreSQL and work with it through the command-line interface.

Our goal is to allow CRUD operations, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, on the API, which will run the corresponding database commands. To do so, we'll set up a route for each endpoint and a function for each query.
